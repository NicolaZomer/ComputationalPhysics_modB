# Computational Physics (mod. B)
This repository contains a collection of algorithms and models for data analysis and their application to simple tasks. The code was developed during the first half of the course [Laboratory of Computational Physics, mod. B](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/SC/SC2443/000ZZ/SCP8082526/N0), year 21-22.

## Topics covered in the course
- [Gradient descent](./01_Gradient_Descent): vanilla and stochastig GD, momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), RMS Prop, Adam, ADA max.
- [Deep neural networks](./02_DNN_Assignment): review of DNN, applications with Keras and Tensorflow. 
- [Convolutional neural networks](./03_CNN): review of CNN, applications with Keras and Tensorflow. 
- [Combining models, focus on XGBoost and tsfresh](.\04_XGBoost_tsfresh): bagging, decision trees, AdaBoost, XGBoost. 
- [Data visualization and clustering](.\05_Visual_Clustering): dimensionality reduction, PCA, t-SNE, K-means, Hierarchical clustering, Density-based (DB) clustering, DBSCAN.
- [Unsupervised learning and Boltzmann machines](.\06_Boltzmann_Machines)

## Assignment
As a weekly exercise, in the second week the professor gave us an assignment on DNN. Unlike the other exercises, in this case we also had to produce a short paper, which can be read at this [link](./02_DNN_Assignment/Assignment_LCP_B.pdf).
